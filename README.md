# Java-Encryption
* Java port of [GCSE Computer Science Python Coursework AQA](https://github.com/BCDeshiG/Python-Encryption-CW).

* About a day's work with some internet problems and optimization.
* Mainly cleaned up repeated code as well as fixing the *Advanced Encryption* Chunking bug.
* Also adapted so the length of the encryption key can be easily changed later.

* Still uses the same algorithm from the (long gone) spec-sheet though so it isn't really that secure.
* As a side effect, that means it's completely compatible with the Python version.
